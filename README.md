# Record aircraft speeding near my Los Angeles neighborhood

This program takes [dump1090-fa](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090)
BaseStation text output from port 30003 and monitors aircraft for
speeders.

Typical usage:

```shell
nc localhost 30003 | speeders
```

In the US the FAA sets what turns out to be a relatively elastic
speed limit of 250 kt for aircraft flying below 10,000 feet MSL.

See [14 CFR ยง 91.117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.117).

Indicated speed is recorded at the aircraft with pitot tubes, so thanks
to "atmospheric conditions" that airspeed will be less than the airspeed
measured by the GPS in the ADS-B system on the aircraft. The program
allows for a 15% faster groundspeed; e.g. the aircraft has a groundspeed
of 288 kt but an indicated airspeed of 250 kt.

It's not unusual to catch aircraft not being compliant with this rule
over the heavily populated San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.
Especially over the roof of my house.
