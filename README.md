# Record aircraft speeding near my Los Angeles neighborhood

This program takes [dump1090-fa](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090)
BaseStation text output from port 30003 and monitors aircraft for
speedy planes.

In the US the FAA sets an indicated speed limit of 250 kt for aircraft
flying below 10,000 feet MSL.

See [14 CFR ยง 91.117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.117).

It's not unusual to see aircraft likely out of compliance with this
rule over the heavily populated San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.

Especially over the roof of my house.

## Prerequisites

```shell
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev python3 python3-pip
sudo mv /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED.old
pip3 install Mastodon.py
```

Curl is used to fetch weather data, XML to extract that data. Python3
is used to optionally send a snarky message to an account at
[botsin.space](https://botsin.space).

## Typical usage

```shell
nc localhost 30003 | speeders
```

## Implementation

Indicated speed is recorded at the aircraft with pitot tubes. Atmospheric
effects mean the indicated airspeed will be less than the airspeed measured
by the GPS in the ADS-B system on the aircraft.

This program receives the GPS speed and altitude of the aircraft via
[dump1090-fa](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090), then
[estimates the indicated airspeed](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/64251)
based on the aircraft's altitude and the projected temperature at that altitude.

The program checks any time the aircraft's estimated indicated speed exceeds
the FAA indicated speed limit for the aircraft's altitude. The most
egregious departure from the limit is stored and reported once the aircraft
flies out of range.

Projected static air temperature is calculated using the standard formula.
Inputs for that formula are acquired from the
[Aviation Weather Center Text Data Server](https://aviationweather.gov)
every 30 minutes.
